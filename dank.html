<h1>Dank's Journey</h1>
<p>As a young bugbear, Dank fled the streets of the no-name town he was born in, hoping to join a travelling circus with a group of friends. To his great dismay, their mini troupe was a front for a cult. Dank kept rank until he was rescued by adventurers in the Valley of the Winds, which he left after being convinced that he could be part of a more prestigious group of performers with them.</p>
<p>Dank still wears the pink tutu and black top hat that he was rescued in, albeit sanitized and mended. His top hat is decorated with patches that purposefully emphasize the damage done by Wretch the Kenku's wolf spider companion Skitter. Although he could easily purchase a new hat or enlist the help of fellow adventurers capable of casting Prestidigitation, he wears the old hat with pride as part of his ringleader costume. If he wears his hat during combat, a successful hit by a melee attack prompts a d20 <em>hat check</em>. On a roll of under 5, his hat falls to the ground. On his next turn he must expend either an action or bonus action (and movement, if required) to pick it up.</p>
<h1>Dank's Circus</h1>
<p>To this day, Dank travels the world as a Bard, believing himself part of a the circus he began with Wretch and Skitter. He is motivated by circus music, gold coins, and the sound of applause. During adventures, he seeks out others with the special talents required to move the hearts and coin purses through performance.<p/>
<p>Members are listed in order by increasing date of official admission to the circus. Last updated 15 September 2017</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Dank</em> is the bugbear bard himself. He is a raconteur and master player of the slide whistle, kazoo, and accordion.</li>
<li><em>Wretch</em> is the Kenku ranger who rescued Dank. With his stellar imitative abilities, he provides the soundtrack for the circus's acts.</li>
<li><em>Skitter</em> is a wolf spider and Wretch's animal familiar. He dances passably, but eight legs moving provide quite a sight.</li> 
<li><em>Li Tanso</em> is currently at large, having joined during <em>Songs of Law & Chaos</em>. She created a minor illusion of a box to hide in once she realized that the cult she was part of was truly dangerous and not just something social to be a part of. After promising to wait for the adventurers, she left the diamond mine where cult activities were being held and has not been seen since.</li>
