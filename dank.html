<h1>Dank's Journey</h1>
<p>As a young bugbear, Dank fled the streets of the no-name town he was born in, hoping to join a travelling circus with a group of friends. To his great dismay, their mini troupe was a front for a cult. Dank kept rank until he was rescued by adventurers in the Valley of the Winds, which he left after being convinced that he could be part of a more prestigious group of performers with them.</p>
<p>Dank still wears the pink tutu and black top hat that he was rescued in, albeit sanitized and mended. His top hat is decorated with patches that purposefully emphasize the damage done by Wretch the Kenku's wolf spider companion Skitter. Although he could easily purchase a new hat or enlist the help of fellow adventurers capable of casting Prestidigitation, he wears the old hat with pride as part of his ringleader costume. If he wears his hat during combat, a successful hit by a melee attack prompts a d20 <em>hat check</em>. On a roll of under 5, his hat falls to the ground. On his next turn he must expend either an action or bonus action (and movement, if required) to pick it up.</p>
<h1>Dank's Circus</h1>
<p>To this day, Dank travels the world as a Bard, believing himself part of a the circus he began with Wretch and Skitter. He is motivated by circus music, gold coins, and the sound of applause. During adventures, he seeks out others with the special talents required to move the hearts and coin purses through performance.<p/>
<p>Members are listed in order by increasing date of official admission to the circus.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Dank</em> is the bugbear bard himself. He is a raconteur and master player of the slide whistle, kazoo, and accordion.</li>
<li><em>Wretch</em> is a Kenku ranger who participated in Dank's rescue. With his stellar imitative abilities, he provides the soundtrack for the circus's acts.</li>
<li><em>Skitter</em> is a wolf spider and Wretch's animal familiar. He dances passably, but eight legs moving at once provide quite a sight.</li> 
<li><em>Li Tanso</em> is currently at large, having joined during <em>Songs of Law & Chaos</em>. She created a minor illusion of a box to hide in once she realized that the cult she was part of was truly dangerous and not just something social to be a part of. After promising to wait for the adventurers, she left the diamond mine where cult activities were being held and has not been seen since.</li>
<li><em>Merric Tealeaf</em> is a halfling rogue who has adventured with Dank in and around Melvaunt. In the circus, he is an acrobat.</li>
<li><em>"Bob"</em> (true name unknown) is a former cultist of Cyric. He is capable of casting Sacred Flame, but his true talents are unknown. In <em>Edicts of Neutrality</em>, Dank recruited him on the mysterious island in the bay of Melvaunt harbor after he defected from the cult of Cyric, having realized it wasn't a summon-and-sell way to get rich quick. Unfortunately, "Bob" was apprehended by Melvaunt High Sail shortly thereafter and is likely dead or rotting in a cell somewhere. Dank doesn't know for sure.</li>

<li><em>Fionnt치n</em> is a firbolg cleric who participated in Dank's rescue. He was initially reluctant to join the circus because of moral objections to deceiving Dank for the purposes of keeping his allegiance, but his opinion changed after the circus began to attract real renown, however scant. However, he prefers to stay to the side, acting only as a keeper for his animals.</li>
<li><em>Balut</em>, also known by the nickname <em>Manok</em>, is Fionnt치n's pet velociraptor. Fionnt치n found her as an egg in the smuggling tunnels beneath Port Nyanzaru in <em>a City on the Edge</em>. She performs basic tricks on the order of playing dead and rolling over, which are still a spectacle outside of Chult.</li>
<li><em>Fergus</em> is Fionnt치n's triceratops, purchased from one of the merchant princes who rule and govern Port Nyanzaru. Fergus does little apart from being a huge dinosaur, which is still impressive to many where they are not a normal sight.</li>
